From source
'''''''''''

Consider this release as Very Alpha. Use at your own risk. It may or may not
upgrade to a more user friendly version in future, depending on my spare time.

Nevertheless, this package support GNU install quite well so a simple::

  autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install

Should work (and has been tested and is currently used).

.. note:: you can specify a prefix thanks to ``--prefix=/your/location`` as
  ``configure`` argument.


From debian package
